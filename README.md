# Speech_Therapy_Project

## Motivation and Introduction
The main objective behind this project was to be able to help people who have impaired speech and want to improve their speech by visiting the Speech Therapist. This is a costly process involving regular visits to the therapist. The project focuses on helping the patient to improve his speech by interacting with the system and based on the feedback it would encourage the patient to do better in his improvement journey. This eliminates the need for regular visits to the therapist. It helps in handling the speech processing in a good way so that the therapist can see the progress from a distance and update the therapy based on the feedback.

Speech Recognition is a technique that is quite popular nowadays. When we speak into a microphone that is connected to the computer/mobile, it converts it to a text file that contains some amplitude values. Those values are basically the deviation of the speech signal from the X-axis. Then we can use this file, do some calculations which can detect which word has been spoken and then further steps can be taken as per the requirement. Such applications are Alexa, Siri, Google Assistant.
